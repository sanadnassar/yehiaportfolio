<div align="center"><h1>📽️ Filmmaking Portfolio | Yehia El-Halaby</h3>

<h3>A minimalist, high-contrast digital portfolio designed for a film student. This project focuses on a "cinematic-first" user experience, using dark themes and smooth transitions to simulate a screening room environment.<h3>


<h2>🚀 Overview</h2>

<h3>The goal of this project was to create a sleek, professional web presence for a filmmaker that balances visual storytelling with interactive UI elements. It transitions from a bold "Director’s Monitor" landing page to an interactive, card-based "About Me" section.</h3>
